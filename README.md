# Classsify-space-radio-signals-with-keras.
In this we are using basic of KERAS with TENSERFLOW as backend to classify 2d spectrograms with the help of CNN.
In this project ,we are using the basics of KERAS with TensorFlow as its backend and use it solve image classification problem. The data consist of 2D spectrograms of deep space radio signals collected by the Allen Telescope Array at SETI Institute. 
They use Allen Telescope Array to scan the night sky for the radio signals to know more about star systems.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100849473/208754964-5e3a9608-e071-43c4-90be-7b182c8ecd4f.png)
